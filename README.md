# Refactoring Exercise
This project takes starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactors it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

## Description
When you load the search engine you are presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.<br>
When you click on the Search for Books menu option you are presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button.<br>
When you are not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button you are presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.<br>
When you click on the Login/Signup menu option a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up.<br>
When the toggle is set to Signup you are presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button.<br>
When the toggle is set to Login you are presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button.<br>
When you enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button your user account is created and you are logged in to the site.<br>
When you enter my account’s email address and password and click on the login button the modal closes and you are logged in to the site.<br>
When you are logged in to the site the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout.<br>
When you are logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button you are presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to your account.<br>
When you click on the Save button on a book that book’s information is saved to your account.<br>
When you click on the option to see your saved books you are presented with all of the books I have saved to my account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from your account.<br>
When you click on the Remove button on a book that book is deleted from your saved books list.<br>
When you click on the Logout button you are logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.
